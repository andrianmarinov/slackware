Microlinux Slackware Files 
==========================

What's this about?
------------------

This repository contains extra software for Slackware Linux, compiled and
packaged by Microlinux, a small Linux-based company in South France:

Complete sources and build scripts are included. You'll also find some
step-by-step documentation.

Binary packages are provided for 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

The software is suitable for desktops (MLED) and servers (MLES). You'll
probably be more interested in the desktop stuff.

My personal collection of Linux-HOWTOs is included. It's in french, but the
*nix bits are more or less universal. ;o)

Check out the README and ChangeLog.txt files in the respective subdirectories
for more information.

Much of this work is really just an assembly of the great work that's been done
before by some excellent folks, and here's the place to give them credit:

  * Robby Workman for his excellent work on Xfce
  * Eric Hameleers for his "impossible" SlackBuild scripts ;o)
  * Daniel de Kok, who worked on the initial scripts back in 2006
  * All the crew from SlackBuilds.org for their really precious work
  * Chess Griffin for his nifty little 'sbopkg' tool 
  * George Vlahavas from the Salix distribution, a fine Slackware spin-off
  * And of course, Patrick Volkerding for creating the "Finest Linux Anywhere"
